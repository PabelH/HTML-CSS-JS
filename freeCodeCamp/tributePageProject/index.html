        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Kobe Bryant's life.</h3>
        <p>Here's how he went from being a decorated high school star to an NBA icon:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1996</strong> - <em>Drafted and traded:</em>  With the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Kobe Bryant, the teenage phenom from Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong> - <em>Slam Dunk Contest Champion:</em> Bryant was 18 by the time All-Star Weekend rolled around. He didn't make the team, but he did participate in the Rookie Challenge, and he won the Slam Dunk Contest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999 - 2002</strong> - <em>Phil Jackson arrives and the three-peat:</em> The Lakers had been a playoff team with Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, but they hadn't quite reached championship form. The furthest they'd made it was to the conference finals. That all changed when Phil Jackson arrived.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> - <em>Fallout with Shaq:</em> Bryant and O'Neal had butted heads since they first teamed up in 1996. Shaq took issue with the style of basketball Bryant played, labeling him “selfish” and a “show off.” Bryant didn't like the way O'Neal conditioned himself for the season and disproved of his antics when he wanted a higher salary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2006</strong> - <em>Career-high 81 points:</em> On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors. It's the second-highest points total in a single game in league history. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008</strong> - <em>Olympian:</em> he United States Men's Basketball team suffered a humiliating finish in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Despite being the overwhelming favorites to win the gold medal, the squad only earned the bronze. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2008 - 2010</strong> - <em>Return to championship form:</em> Bryant was already a three-time champion, but he had never won one without Shaq. O'Neal had gone on to win another title in Miami. And the supporting cast Bryant had played with since O'Neal's departure was never nearly as talented. But when the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol in February 2008, Bryant's fortunes changed for the better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - <em>Final Olympic medal:</em> Bryant donned the red, white and blue for the final time in 2012. He won his final gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - <em>'Dear Basketball'/Retirement:</em> Bryant spent the rest of his career chasing a sixth NBA title, which would have tied him with Michael Jordan. But injuries plagued him his final few seasons. On Nov. 29, 2015, Bryant published a poem in The Players Tribune, titled “Dear Basketball.” In it, he announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - <em>Jersey retirement:</em> On Dec. 18, 2017, the Lakers retired Bryant's jersey numbers. He'd worn No. 8 until 2006, when he changed to No. 24. He'd first worn 24 in high school before changing to 33.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - <em>Oscar:</em> Bryant made an animated short film out of his “Dear Basketball” poem. The following March, he added another trophy to his collection. “Dear Basketball” won the Oscar for Best Animated short Film at the 90th Academy Awards. The film also took home a Sports Emmy and the Annie Award that year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - <em>Died:</em> dies at the age of 41.
